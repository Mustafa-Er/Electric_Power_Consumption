I am trying to predict after 24 hours Global_active_power feature


About Dataset

  This dataset contains 2075259 measurements collected between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months) in a house located in Sceaux (7 km from Paris, France).
  
  1.date: date in dd/mm/yyyy format
  
  2.time: time in hh:mm:ss format
  
  3.global_active_power: household global minute average active power (in kilowatts)
  
  4.global_reactive_power: household global minute average reactive power (in kilowatts)
  
  5th voltage: minute averaged voltage (in volts)
  
  6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in amperes)
  
  7.sub_metering_1: Energy sub-metering number 1 (in watt-hours of active energy). It mainly corresponds to the kitchen, which includes a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave oven (hobs are gas, not electric).
  
  8.sub_metering_2: Energy submetering number 2 (in watt-hours of active energy). Corresponds to the laundry room containing a washing machine, a tumble dryer, a refrigerator and a light.
  
  9.sub_metering_3: Energy submetering number 3 (in watt-hours of active energy). Corresponds to an electric water heater and an air conditioner.
  
  Explanations of Some Terms:
  
  Active Power: The useful, useful power drawn from the network by the receivers in electrical circuits is called Active Power. For example; Electric current is transformed into heat in heaters, into heat in heaters, into motion in motors, and into light in lighting fixtures.
  
  Reactive Power: In electrical circuits, the power that is drawn from the source and then returned to the source is called Reactive Power. It provides the formation of the magnetic field in motors and coil circuits and the required electric field in capacitors. The power drawn from the source for the formation of these fields is returned to the source again as the fields disappear. Reactive power is also known as blind power because it has no equivalent in receivers. If necessary precautions are not taken, they occupy unnecessary capacity in the network. Reactive power is indicated by the VAR unit, which is the abbreviation of the words Volt Ampere Reactive.
  
  In short Active, Reactive Power
  
  The power dissipated by a load is called active power. Active power is symbolized by the letter P.
  
  Power that is only absorbed and returned in the load due to its reactive properties is called reactive power.
